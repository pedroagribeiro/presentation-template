The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side
opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two
sides. We can express this idea with the following equation $$a^2+b^2=c^2$$
where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are sides of a triangle.

We can also use other types of symbols to describe mathematical ideas. The
area of a circle is define as $A_{circle}= \pi \times r^2$.
