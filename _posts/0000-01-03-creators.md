            TeX is a typesetting system (or "formatting system") designed and mostly
            written by Donald Knuth and released in 1978. Together with the
            Metafont language for font description and the Computer Modern
            family of typefaces, TeX was designed with two main goals in mind:
            to allow anybody to produce high-quality books using minimal
            effort, and to provide a system that would give exactly the same
            results on all computers, at any point in time.
          </p>
          <p class="supplement">
            TeX is free software, which made it accessible to a wide range of users.

          <p>LaTeX (shortening of Lamport TeX) is a document preparation
          system. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the
          formatted text found in WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get")
          word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple
          Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the
          general structure of a document (such as article, book, and
          letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and
          italics), and to add citations and cross-references.</p>
          <p class="supplement">A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MikTeX
          is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for
          printing or digital distribution.</p>
